texture-synthesis
=================

Author: Vladan Nikolic

This is an assignment completed at the National University of Singapore (NUS). It was part of the course EE4212 Computer Vision.

The main program is in the file texture_sythesis.m, just run the code in matlab, but don't forget to change the input texture image name. The result can be improved by increasing the window_size variable, but the computational time will increase exponentially.

The program will estimate how the texture pattern should continue given a texture sample.

Have fun!
